Cosine Similarity - Information Retrival
================================================
ðŸ”Ž Positional Index and Cosine Similarity

Description
-----------

This project is designed to read text files, build an inverted index, and perform cosine similarity calculations to rank files based on their similarity to a given query. The project utilizes web crawling with JSoup in Java to gather data from Wikipedia pages, with options to limit the crawl depth. Multi-threading is employed to enhance performance, ensuring faster content retrieval from Wikipedia pages.

Features
--------

âœ… Read 10 text files  
âœ… Build the inverted index for the 10 files  
âœ… Accept user queries consisting of a set of words  
âœ… Compute the cosine similarity between each file and the query  
âœ… Rank the 10 files based on cosine similarity values

Installation
------------

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    ```
    
2.  Import the project into your Java IDE.
    
3.  Download and add the JSoup library to your project.
    
4.  Update the path of the folder and files in the `Config.java` file according to your system:
    
    java
    
    ```java
    public class Config {
        public static final String FOLDER_PATH = "/path/to/folder";  // Update folder path
        public static final String[] FILENAMES = {"file1.txt", "file2.txt", ..., "file10.txt"};  // Update file names
    }
    ```
    

Usage
-----

1.  Run the main Java class in your IDE.
    
2.  Follow the prompts to initiate the process.
    

Configuration
-------------

You can modify the following parameters in the `Config.java` file:

*   `NUM_FILES`: Number of text files to read (default: 10)
*   `CRAWL_DEPTH`: Depth of web crawling (default: 2)
*   `NUM_THREADS`: Number of threads for multi-threading (default: 4)
